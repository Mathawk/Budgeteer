# Budgeteer

## Problem Statement
A lot of people are unorganized when looking at their finacials. A direct case is seen at people at the HSBA, who live at home, don't really have any spensses and still manage to spend all their money every month.
To offer investing / saving options and keep an overview over your own financials, we need an application that not only categorizes your expenses. We need an app that actively reminds you WHEN PAYING, 
that you are exceeding your set budget for that month, on a certain category of expenses.

That way, when paying for a new pair of shoes, you need to actively confirm the payment and exceeding, which creates a mental barrier and a feeling on how much money is actually spent on certain things each month.

## Acceptance Criteria
The app should be available for android smartphones. It should have access to the account information (account balance/transactions) and categorize theses transactions.
The User should be able to see his balance, transactions, spendings in certain categories, and how much of the respective budgets is still open for the month.
The app should have the feature to either pay via NFC or directly see transactions that happen via google pay. As soon as a budget is surpassed a warning message should be displayed.
