# Budgeteer

## Problem Statement
A lot of people are unorganized when looking at their financials. 
A direct case is seen at some people at the HSBA, who live at home, don't really have any expenses and still manage to spend all their money every month.
To offer investing / saving options and keep an overview over your own financials, we need an application that not only categorizes your expenses. 
We need an app that actively reminds you WHEN PAYING, that you are exceeding your set budget for that month, on a certain category of expenses.

## Scenario
For example when paying for a new pair of shoes, a watch or something else, you need to actively confirm the payment and exceeding,
This creates a mental barrier and a feeling on how much money is actually spent on certain things each month. 
In the long run the app will help you save money and you will become more aware of the activities on your bank account.

## Requirements
Access to your account balances. Real-time overview of all your transactions made via the added accounts.
Expanses are categorized and user can select a monthly budget for each category and a total budget for all categories.
Push notification are send when you're exceeding your pre-selected monthly budget.

## Target
The main application will be used on smartphones. Therefore a mobile app needs to be developed. The app will likely be developed for the operating systems Apple iOS and Google Android, since these are the two largest mobile operating systems.

To conduct and analyze payments, the app needs a backend. This backend will be hosted on a server.

A web page might be included in future releases but is not needed for an minimum viable product (MVP).

## Acceptance Criteria
The app should be available for android smartphones. It should have access to the account information (account balance/transactions) and categorize theses transactions. 
The User should be able to see his balance, transactions, spendings in certain categories, and how much of the respective budgets is still open for the month. 
The app should have the feature to either pay via NFC or directly see transactions that happen via google pay. 
As soon as a budget is surpassed a warning message should be displayed.
